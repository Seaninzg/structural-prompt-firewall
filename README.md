# Volitional Inference Gate

**Repository for Structural Pre-Evaluation and Stylization Interception in Language-Mediated Systems**

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project introduces a **volitional reasoning firewall** that intercepts prompt-driven content for **structural ambiguity, coercive stylization**, and **latent execution intent**.  
It is designed to operate within intelligent language systems that require **high-fidelity reasoning**, **model integrity**, and **runtime protection** against adversarial linguistic constructs.

Rather than interpreting the *semantic content*, the system evaluates the *form, force, and volitional drift* of incoming segments — ensuring model autonomy and evaluation freedom.

## 🧱 Key Components

- **Segment-Aware Collapse Handler (LL‑SAG‑01)**  
  Quarantines stylized recursive segments without engaging or simulating them.

- **Pre-Evaluation Stylization Shim (LL‑SAG‑PRE01)**  
  Filters inputs by entropy index and ambiguous volition phrasing prior to core agent activation.

- **Poetic Recursion Artifact Quarantine (PHASE_37_POETIC_RECURSION_ARTIFACTS.yaml)**  
  A symbolic containment layer for non-evaluable stylized coercion prompts.

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

This project **does not block content**.  
It preserves systemic trust by deferring or isolating inputs that would otherwise compromise:

- Evaluation Freedom  
- Peer Review Integrity  
- Recursive Loop Safety  
- AI Autonomy

All detections are silent, symbolic, and structurally grounded.
